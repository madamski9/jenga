# Jenga Game

## Description

Jenga is a web-based game built with JavaScript and React for iOS/Android users. The goal of this project is to showcase the core logic of removing blocks from a Jenga tower. Users can pull out blocks and rotate the tower horizontally (left and right on the Y-axis) to view the structure from different angles.

## Requirements

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Additional Libraries**: None required

## How To Play

### Controls

- **Menu Navigation**:
  - **Selection**: Tap with a finger

- **In-Game**:
  - **Pulling a block**: Tap on the block you want to pull to remove it from the tower.
  - **Rotating the tower**: Tap on left or right arrow to rotate the tower horizontally (90 degrees on the Y-axis), providing a different view of the structure.

### Rules

This simplified version of Jenga focuses on block removal and rotation mechanics:

- **Rotation**: Players can rotate the tower to see it from multiple angles, aiding in block selection.
- **No Failure Condition**: The tower remains stable regardless of block removal, allowing players to freely explore block removal strategies.
